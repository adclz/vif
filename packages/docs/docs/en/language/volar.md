# Volar

An experimental [Volar](https://volarjs.dev/) plugin available as a vscode extension.

This plugin listens for the output of a task-runner using its socket feature, and then provide semantic diagnostics in your Ide.

Since this is an early stage, the plugin cannot do much more than highlighting code and is probably still very buggy.
