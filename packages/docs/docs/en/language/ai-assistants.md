# Artificial Intelligence

Nowadays AI is everywhere, including in most IDEs, many of which have a built-in AI code assistant.

However, it's important to note that Vif currently doesn't provide any AI-related features. Despite this, as Vif utilizes plain TypeScript (understood by all code assistants), so it's possible to use an AI to assist you.

Both the AI i have tested ([ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) and [JetBrains AI](https://www.jetbrains.com/ai/)) are understanding what's going on (aka programming a PLC with TypeScript) when provided some Vif code.

But the code generated is still at an early stage and require a bit of prompt engineering before getting something clean.

I'm not going to share any prompts since those are more drafts than serious work.

Furthermore, with the rise of custom AI platforms it is possible for anyone to publish a good fine tuned of any AI for Vif (such as [GPT Store](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store) or [Mistral plateforme](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme/)).

_You should see this as a green flag for "go on, make your own AI and sell it if you want to", because it is not something i will primarily focus on._
