# S7 Agent

This agent is registered on Windows with `vif-agent-s7`.

Uses Tia Portal Openness to compile some code in Tia Portal.

:::info
Since Openness is a Windows executable, it can't be installed on Linux.

However if an instance is waiting for a request, any device can send a network request to the agent.
:::

[init-vif](/en/install/install) can set up a dev environment with this provider.

This program will check if Tia Portal is running on your computer and attempt to compile Vif output.

It accepts one of the following arguments:

```
A link               https:///www.yourlink.com/program.json
A file path          "C:Path\Folder\program.json"
A json object        "{ "file://myblock": { ... } }"
--web                Waits for post
```

When `--web` is used, it will boot a small web server, creates an access token and waits for a client to receive data.

:::warning
`--web` will always launch a web sever with a `localhost` url, it can only be accessed inside a local network.

## Download

For security reasons, [init-vif](/en/install/install) won't install this agent automatically.
